    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Mav (they/them), welcome to how I tell my story.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I'm based in SF but frequently travel to NYC, CHI, and BOS.</li>
        <li>I grew up in the Chicago suburbs, changing schools frequently before finding a home at a Naperville high school.</li>
        <li>I'm an only child and my parents immigrated from Beijing, China. Speaks solid mandarin for an ABC.</li>
        <li>Both my grandfathers were professors, one taught physics in military school, another taught economics in business school. I like to think I'm combining both of their legacies by living in the interdisciplinary field of behavioral economics.</li>
        <li>I learned how social interactions worked by reading How to Win Friends and Influence People in middle school.</li>
        <li>I grew up Christian, lost faith, and am in the process of finding my way back to God. Inspired by my roots in Confucianism and Zen Buddhism as well.</li>
        <li>I'm often and enjoy being the only person that looks like me in a room.</li>
        <li>I'm obsessed with games, markets, incentives and climate change. If you're building in carbon markets, grid decentralization, please reach out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Health & Wellness</h2>
    <p>I've sacrificed health for work for many years, turning it around before it's too late.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I meditate every morning. Prayer is a form of meditation.</li>
        <li>I go to therapy regularly.</li>
        <li>I'm an avid <a href="https://huel.mention-me.com/m/ol/dd3qm-mav-li">Huel</a> drinker</li>
        <li>A smoothie blender is a human's best friend.</li>
        <li>I enjoy weightlifting, snowboarding, skateboarding, boxing. I also can play squash, climb, sim race, sail, horseback ride.</li>
        <li>For the mind, chess, poker, various board and card games are great activities.</li>
        <li>In another life (hopefully this one) I would've been a race car driver, standup comedian, EDM DJ, monk.</li>
        <li>I'm in the process of getting my motorcycle license.</li>
        <li>My biggest mistake has been isolating myself. Nothing worthwhile is done alone. One must have friends, advisors, and mentors.</li>
        <li>I'm a night owl, am most productive and lively at night. The productivity unlock would be insane if society were flexible and built not just for early birds, for night owls too.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Background & Work</h2>

        <li>Harvard grad whose dream school was Stanford</li>

    </ul>

        <li>buying VIX in March 2020</li>
        <li>shorting LUNA at $45 on Drift Protocol, a Solana DEX</li>

        <li>I'm an FTX creditor</li>
    </ul>
